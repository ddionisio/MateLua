MateLua
======

Mate Interface and Helper API for Lua using [UniLua](https://github.com/xebecnan/UniLua), requires [MateUnity](https://github.com/ddionisio/MateUnity).

This API is primarily used for the Web Player, hence the importance of having a managed Lua interpreter.

All lua files are loaded from Resources and Asset Bundle. Feature to load from external resource will come along later (ability to grab lua files from external sources, outside of Asset Bundle) 

##TODO

* More Unity hook-ups
* Any more useful stuff from the Lua API
